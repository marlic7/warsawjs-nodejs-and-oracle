This method obtains a connection from the connection pool.

If a previously opened connection is available in the pool, that connection is returned.
If all connections in the pool are in use, a new connection is created and returned to
the caller, as long as the number of connections does not exceed the specified maximum
for the pool. If the pool is at its maximum limit, the getConnection() call results in an error,
 such as ORA-24418: Cannot open further sessions.
